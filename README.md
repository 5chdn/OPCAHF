# CAHF: A contingency plan against Byzantium HF & POS Change(EIP649)
### Definitions
HF: HF stands for Hardfork.  Developers add a mandatory rule set to change the node software. These changes make previously invalid blocks become valid. Nodes/Miners with the rule set changes will follow this chain if they have a consensus.

Byzantium HF: Byzantium Hardfork is an hard fork from the post-chain(Called Mainnet Homestead chain). It may follow EIP649 and will be the bedrock of POS(Proof-of-Stake) release.

POW: POW stands for Proof-of-work ecosystem. A chain or network using POW may consume a lot of energy but has an effictive, sustainable security system.

POS: POS stands for Proof-of-stake ecosystem. A chain or network using POS may consume less energy than POW but may have security risk and less circulation on tokens.

EIP649 node: a Bitcoin node that has implemented BIP148 consensus rule changes.]

EIP649 chain: a blockchain that is valid according to the BIP148 consensus rule changes. BIP148 is a kind of UASF.

Original chain(Homestead): The blockchain that uses the same consensus rules in use today.

Circulating Supply(Homestead): Circulating Sypply(or total amount of released or issued ether by mining & pre-sale)
