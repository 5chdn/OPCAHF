# CAHF: A contingency plan against Byzantium HF & POS Change(EIP649)
### Definitions
HF: HF stands for Hardfork.  Developers add a mandatory rule set to change the node software. These changes make previously invalid blocks become valid. Nodes/Miners with the rule set changes will follow this chain if they have a consensus.

CAHF: CAHF Stands for Community Activated Hard Fork. Like HF, developers add a mandatory rule set to change the node software and these changes make previously invalid blocks become valid. The CAHF proposal is a peaceful and voluntary departure of different community members who have different opinions or visions, and it is not intended to make an attack against other blockchain(s), even if the CAHF chain has the higher hash rate or higher value.

Byzantium HF: Byzantium Hardfork is an hard fork from the post-chain(Called Mainnet Homestead chain). It may follow EIP649 and will be the bedrock of POS(Proof-of-Stake) release.

POW: POW stands for Proof-of-work ecosystem. A chain or network using POW may consume a lot of energy but has an effictive, sustainable security system.

POS: POS stands for Proof-of-stake ecosystem. A chain or network using POS may consume less energy than POW but may have security risk and less circulation on tokens.

Difficulty-Bomb: 

EIP649 node: a Bitcoin node that has implemented BIP148 consensus rule changes.

EIP649 chain: a blockchain that is valid according to the BIP148 consensus rule changes. BIP148 is a kind of UASF.

Original chain(Homestead): The blockchain that uses the same consensus rules in use today.

Circulating Supply(Homestead): Circulating Supply(or total amount of released or issued ether by mining & pre-sale) of Ethereum Mainnet. Now Circulating Supply is approx. 94 million ether.

### Background

Like all Ethereum users knows, Ethereum has passed over several forks including mainnet HF. Several HF that have initiated to Ethereum mainnet caused several consensus between ethereum foundation & miners & the community. Despite that changes of mainnet consensus and protocol updates maintained ethereum's roadmap & inherent value, However, All Hard forks wasn't able to pull all user's agreement. For example, Hardfork that contains refund of The DAO hack occured chain split to the one's who did not updated their protocol(Known as Ethereum-Classic chain), and the hard forked chain(Now the main-net of Ethereum) 

After 1 years later of the chain split, Ethereum's main-net has scheduled to change to Metropolis, and if so main-net chain may pass 2 Hardforks called Byzantium and constantinople hard fork. Before byzantium ethereum main-net chain's mean block time has been increased due to an extreme difficulty increase by a code called Difficulty-Bomb code. It's code's purpose was to give an incentive when
